Question: Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

 Solution:
 class Solution:    
    def addStrings(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        converted_values = {'0':0, '1':1, '2':2, '3':3, '4':4, '5':5, '6':6, '7':7, '8':8, '9':9}
        def strTonum(s):
            n = 0
            for i in s:
                n = n * 10 + converted_values[i]
            return n
        return str(strTonum(num1)+strTonum(num2))
